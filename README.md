# OrganizingLife

A lightweight prototype of a Monday.com-style board experience for personal, finance, and work tasks. It includes mock Gmail/Outlook 365 integrations and lets you add tasks with status, due date, and priority.

## Run locally

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.
